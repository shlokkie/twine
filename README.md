Workflow recommendations for text classification problems

## Hello
These are the supporting files of my dissertation on text classification problems for the MSc in Data Analytics at Faculdade de Economia da Universidade do Porto.

## Contents
Through these folders you can find my R Code (scripts folder), the results obtained (data) and the auxiliary files used in the analysis. You can also find the loss curves generated from my data (folder AT-AR). The code used to generate those is not available here since it was based on the adaptation of someone else's code (Salusu Abdulrahman, the main author of the original method). The intertwine folder is filled with the scripts and several files that were used for the analysis of the resulting data.

## Datasets
The original datasets used for my dissertation were found online. I make them available here simply for simplification purposes. They are all referenced in the thesis and their sources are:

* 20 News Groups Dataset: http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/
* OHSUMED Dataset: http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/corpora.htm
* Reuters (r8 - single label) Dataset: http://ana.cachopo.org/datasets-for-single-label-text-categorization
